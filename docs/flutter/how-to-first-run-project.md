## How to first run project

### 1. You can fetch dependencies by clicking the "Get Packages" button at the top of your pubspec.yaml file, or by running `flutter pub get` in the terminal. Both methods will install all required packages for your project.

### 2. After fetching the packages (by clicking "Get Packages" in the upper right of pubspec.yaml), you need to open the `main.dart` file to get the option for running the app. You can also press **F5** as a shortcut to run the app. Then, click the **Run** button (as shown in the image below) to start your Flutter application on the selected device or emulator.
